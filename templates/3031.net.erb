# === Options
#
# [*domain-needed*]
#   Block incomplete requests from leaving your network, such as google vs. google.com
#
# [*bogus-priv*]
#   Bogus private reverse lookups. All reverse lookups for private IP ranges (ie 192.168.x.x, etc)
#   which are not found in /etc/hosts or the DHCP leases file are answered with "no such domain"
#   rather than being forwarded upstream.
#
# [*domain*]
#   Provides the domain part for "expand-hosts"
#
# [*expand-hosts*]
#   Have a domain automatically added to simple names in a hosts-file
#   i.e. entries without the domain specified in /etc/hosts
#
# [*local*]
#   Add local-only domains here, queries in these domains are answered from /etc/hosts only
#
# [*no-dhcp-interface*]
#   Do not provide DHCP or TFTP on the specified interface, but do provide DNS service
#
# [*no-resolv*]
#   Don't read /etc/resolv.conf. Get upstream servers only
#   from the command line or the dnsmasq configuration file
#
# [*no-poll*]
#   Don't poll /etc/resolv.conf for changes
#
# [*server*]
#   Where to forward Internet DNS requests (things not specified in /etc/hosts)
